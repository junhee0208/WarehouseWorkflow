WMS App for Picking and Packing Process
Overview
Create a web-based Warehouse Management System (WMS) application that focuses on the picking and packing process. The app should scan barcodes/QR codes to fetch product details from a database and display available stock in the warehouse. This system aims to streamline warehouse operations by providing real-time inventory visibility and simplifying the picking and packing workflow.

Core Requirements
1. User Interface
Clean, responsive design that works on desktop and mobile devices
Dashboard showing key metrics (pending orders, completed picks, inventory status)
Barcode/QR code scanning interface
Product detail view showing stock information
Pick list creation and management
Packing verification screen
2. Functionality
Barcode/QR code scanning (using device camera)
Product lookup and inventory display
Pick list generation and management
Order fulfillment tracking
Basic inventory adjustment capabilities
User authentication and role-based access
3. Data Management
Product database with inventory levels
Order database with status tracking
User database with roles and permissions
Activity logging for audit purposes
